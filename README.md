# Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Energy, Economy, and Research Indicators

This project analyzes global energy, economy, and research indicators using publicly available datasets, providing insights into economic performance, renewable energy production, and research metrics across countries and continents.

## Features

- **Data Sources:**
    - Filtered datasets from UN Energy, World Bank GDP, and Scimago for the top 15 countries ranked by energy research.

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**
    - Merged and cleaned datasets by addressing missing data, removing unnecessary columns, and standardizing naming conventions.

- **Key Insights:**
    - Identified top GDP countries and analyzed trends for those above and below the median renewable energy production.
    - Classified countries by renewable electricity production percentage.
    - Summarized data by continent for comparative analysis.

- **Metrics & Derived Calculations:**
    - Computed self-citation ratios for research impact evaluation.
    - Estimated populations from energy supply per capita for contextual understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data processing and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive data exploration.
- **Data Sources:** UN Energy, World Bank GDP, Scimago.

## Results and Visualizations

The analysis includes:
- Visualizations of GDP vs. renewable energy production.
- Classification charts by continent for renewable electricity production.
- Heatmaps showing self-citation ratios and derived metrics.
